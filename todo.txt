extend help to specific commands
have resource management mechanic implemented (system resources, port mechanic [in order to access a port you have to have it open])
port mechanic - local ports must be open to access remote ports

XXX you can't tell how much system resources you have
XXX fw -o and fw -c needs a div
XXX closing ports uses up system resources
XXX set margin to ui.status



OBVIOUS but not within time
 be able to run multiple flags if necessary fw -o 24 -c 100

implement a sim of being attacked - NEXT STAGE BEFORE MULTIPLAYER
implement delay for nmap so its not instantaneous
multiplayer
file system
connecting to remote computer and stealing root file
crypto upgrading ports




THINGS I DONT LIKE
pwn a port and knowing specifically how much health it's at.
-Maybe there should be more complexity to attacking a port than just a rote automatic attack. Like a puzzle.
-maybe there could be a delay
-a Minesweeper minigame??? INTERESTING IDEA


DESIGN
What else can I spend crypto on?
upgrading pwn to do more damage
upgrading crackerjack to do more passwords per second


Once you've stolen a root file, is it just a wallet? If rootfile is more than that, and is root access to the original computer, it creates complications.
Maybe dont' even call it root. Just call it wallet.

Outside of opening a port, that should be the first step in gaining access to a computer.
